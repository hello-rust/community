# ⚙️❤️ Hello Rust Community 

Until real-world meetups are back, some would like to stay in contact with the Rust community in the meantime.  
We don't want to start a full-blown meetup, so here's a quick way to schedule online get-togethers.  

## Announce Your Own Meetup

1. Open an issue.
2. That's it! 😲
